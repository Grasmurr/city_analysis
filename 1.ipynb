    "In this project, the focus is set on the exploration and analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing \n",
    "worldwide university rankings. This dataset, combining three distinct global university rankings, provides \n",
    "a variety of information, including the institution name, country, national rank, quality of education, \n",
    "alumni employment, quality of faculty, publications, influence, citations, broad impact, patents, score, and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to implement and utilize Python \n",
    "programming skills to interact with, filter, and sort the data. Through this project, a better \n",
    "understanding of data manipulation and analysis using Python is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes three main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "filter_universities(data): This function is designed to filter universities based on the user's \n",
    "    input for country, year, and minimum score. The resulting set of universities is written to a \n",
    "    new CSV file named 'filtered_universities.csv'. This interactive function caters to the user's specific \n",
    "    needs and provides precise information accordingly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "above_average_by_year(data): This function is created to evaluate the average university score for each \n",
    "    year and identify those universities with scores above the average in their respective year. The output \n",
    "    is written into an 'above_average.csv' file. This function provides insights into the universities \n",
    "    performing above average annually.\n",
    "    \n",
    "sorted_universities(data): The objective of this function is to sort universities based on their scores. \n",
    "    It further filters universities based on a specific country as per the user's input. The sorted data \n",
    "    is written into a 'sorted_universities.csv' file. This function aids in obtaining a sorted list of \n",
    "    universities from a specific country, providing an easy comparative analysis\n",
